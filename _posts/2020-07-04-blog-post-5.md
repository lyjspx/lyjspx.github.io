In [Samtools manual](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf "Samtools manual"), the SEQ field is not fully defined. 

> SEQ: segment SEQuence.  This field can be a ‘ \* ’  when the sequence is not stored.  If not a ‘*’, the lengthof the sequence must equal the sum of lengths ofM/I/S/=/Xoperations inCIGAR. An ‘=’ denotes thebase is identical to the reference base.  No assumptions can be made on the letter cases. 

------------
Bowtie2 will print read sequence in this field.

if aligned to the reverse strand, reverse-complemented reads sequence will be printed.

Tested, confirmed.

------------

BWA probably does it in the same way.

> 10	SEQ	query SEQuence on the same strand as the reference

No test yet


------------

Samtools fasta/fastq
It probabaly dumps read/sequences by QNAME. It means it is not dumping SEQ field. Raw reads will be output.
